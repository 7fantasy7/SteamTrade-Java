Test Files
==========
`inventorytest_99900.json` is a sample file to test the functionality of the TradeInternalAsset class.  Sourced from Spiral Knights, it includes one currency item (Crowns), one stackable item (Blue Shard), and one non-stackable item (Heart Pendant).

Hopefully more test files will be added later for other stuff, like maybe to help finish up the TradeListener implementation to support currencies and stackables events.

While we're here, I wonder how easy it'd be to download updated inventory data and run tests against that?
